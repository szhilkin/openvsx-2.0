The hastate command sets the VSX core service as active or inactive. In a single VSX configuration, the VSX is active by default and should not be changed to inactive. In a fault-tolerant HA configuration, the primary VSX is set to active and the secondary VSX is set to inactive. The active VSX node (primary or secondary) is responsible for servicing the VSX core configuration.

In a well functioning configuration, the secondary VSX is inactive and monitors the active, primary VSX. If the secondary VSX is unable to communicate with the primary via SAN connection or the primary goes inactive, the secondary switches to active mode and assumes control and service of the core configuration.  Once the secondary becomes active, the user can only relinquish control back to the primary (and return to a fault tolerant configuration) by setting the secondary inactive.  If the primary connection is unavailable, the secondary will refuse to go inactive.

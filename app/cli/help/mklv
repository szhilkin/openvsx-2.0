The mklv command creates logical volumes (LVs) from a specified pool.  The size of the LV must be entered in decimal form with a T, G, M or K suffix to indicate the size in Terabytes, Gigabytes, Megabytes, or Kilobytes, respectively. If no suffix is specified, the number specified is interpreted as a byte count.

By default data extents are immediately allocated from the pool.  The optional flag -t will create a thinly provisioned LV. Data extents will be allocated as needed.

LV names must be alphanumeric, no more than 16 characters, and must be unique across all pools.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

	mklv pool 100G lv00-10

Define a VSX-pair named RNAME with a primary IP address and an optional secondary IP address. RNAME is a local abstract name.

This command fails if:

   * RNAME exceeds 20 characters
   * address has no security parameters
   * address has been assigned by a previous setremote
   * the primary address and the secondary address are the same

setremote RNAME without more arguments removes the VSX-pair. The remove fails if RNAME is used by a shadowrecv or shadowsend command.

The mkpv command formats an SR/SRX target LUN as a Physical Volume (PV), adding its extents to the unallocated (free) space of a pool.  The specified pool must already exist.  A pool may only contain 128 PVs.  The following restrictions are necessary to format a target LUN:

The LUN is online
The LUN does not have any MAC masks configured
The LUN has no data stored on it (it will be lost in format)
The LUN is not being used by any other initiators or Coraid appliances
The LUN is not already allocated as a PV, mirror target, or shadow target.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify target LUNs:

	mkpv pool 100.0-10

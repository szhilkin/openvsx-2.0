The harole command defines the primary (main) VSX or secondary (back up) VSX appliance in an HA configuration. In a single VSX configuration, the VSX appliance is primary by default and should not be changed to secondary.  In a fault-tolerant HA configuration utilizing a pair of VSX appliances, one unit should be configured as the primary VSX and the other as the secondary.  The secondary VSX monitors the primary over a SAN connection.  If the SAN connection fails or the primary itself becomes inactive (see 'help hastate'), the secondary becomes active and serves the VSX core configuration.

The HA role should be defined once at configuration time and should not be changed in a running config.

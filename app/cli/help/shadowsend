shadowsend RNAME LV [...] to target_LV [...]

Configure the shadow process to send LV's snapshots to target_LV at remote VSX-pair RNAME.

This command fails if:

   * the remote VSX is unusable because both primary and secondary are either:
      * unreachable
      * fails authentication
      * inactive
   * the remote VSX does not have the named shadow source LV and shadow target LV configured for the sending VSX (shadowrecv)
   * the shadow target LV is smaller than the source LV
   * a snapshot with the same number does not have the same class and timestamp on both ends
   * a snapshot with the same timestamp does not have the same number on both ends
   * the most recent snapshot for the target LV does not exist for the source LV

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

        shadowsend Tulsa LV20-25
        shadowsend Tulsa LV30-35 to LV60-65

The lvresize command resizes logical volumes (LVs).  The size of the LV must be entered in decimal form with a T, G, M or K suffix to indicate the size in Terabytes, Gigabytes, Megabytes, or Kilobytes, respectively. If no suffix is specified, the number specified is interpreted as a byte count.

Only LV expansion is currently supported.  New extents are allocated from the pool to satisfy the new LV size.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

	lvresize 100G lv00-10

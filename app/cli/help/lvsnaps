The lvsnaps command displays all snapshots in all defined pools.  The display list can be restricted by providing one or more LV arguments.  If an LV that is not a snapshot is specified, all snapshots for the LV are displayed.  The displayed status includes the name of the snapshot, snap timestamp, size in gigabytes, snapshot schedule, class, and hold status.

The snap timestamp is a 15 digit number formatted as YearMonthDate.HourMinSec.  Hour is specified using a 24 hour clock.  A timestamp of 20101026.214002 represents 2010 October 26, 2140 (9:40pm) and 2 seconds.

The -a flag displays additional information often useful for Coraid Technical Support.  The -s flag sorts snapshots by their schedule.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

	lvsnaps LV.1-10

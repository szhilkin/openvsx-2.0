The configrestore command restores the VSX to a specified configuration, erasing all local configuration including destruction of any data configuration.  A .vsxcfg file must be from configsave, see 'help configsave'.  Without arguments, configrestore displays all .vsxcfg files in the local file holding area that have been uploaded by scp/ftp.  Specifying a .vsxcfg file (configrestore ip_ccyymmdd.hhmmss.vsxcfg) restores the VSX.  After restoring a prior VSX configuration, a reboot is enforced.  Confirmation is required.

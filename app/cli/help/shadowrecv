shadowrecv RNAME source_LV [...] to LV [...]

Make LV a shadow target for receiving snapshots from the source_LV at the remote VSX-pair RNAME.

TCP port 17760 is used to listen for connections from a shadowsend.

This command fails if:

   * RNAME was not defined by setremote
   * LV has a LUN assigned to it
   * LV is used for shadowsend
   * LV is a snapshot LV
   * LV has data that is not in its most recent snapshot

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

        shadowrecv Tulsa LVa to LVb
        shadowrecv Tulsa LV50-55 to LV70-75

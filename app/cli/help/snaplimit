The snaplimit command displays the snapshot limit for scheduled snapshots of LVs. If no LVs are given all LV scheduled snapshot limits are printed.

For more information on the snapshot limit see 'help setsnaplimit'. 

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

	snaplimit LV00-10

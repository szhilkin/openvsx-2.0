The pvs command displays all PVs in all defined pools.  The display list can be restricted by providing one or more PV arguments.  The displayed status includes PV name, total size in gigabytes, unallocated (free) space in gigabytes, mirror target, state, and associated pool.  The -a flag displays additional information often useful for Coraid Technical Support.

Mirror state is one of:

   single - PV is not mirrored.
  missing - SR/SRX LUN underlying PV cannot be loaded.
   broken - Mirroring has failed; mirror element is now out of sync.
silvering - PV primary is being intelligently copied to the mirror.
 mirrored - PV primary and mirror are in sync; PV is fault tolerant.

The states single, broken, silvering, and mirrored may also be appended with lost if the PV disappears from the SAN.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify PVs:

	pvs 100.0-10

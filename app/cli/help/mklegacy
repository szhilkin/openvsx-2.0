The mklegacy command creates an LV in a specified pool from a legacy LUN.  A legacy LUN is an SR/SRX LUN with existing data on it created using the EM/EMX, or by direct access.  Because the legacy LUN target lacks space for metadata extents on itself, metadata for a legacy LUN is stored on another PV in the pool.  At creation time, the specified pool must have enough space to accommodate the legacy metadata.

The rollback command sets an LV to the same state as it had at the time of a previous snapshot.  The current LV and all snapshots in between are removed.  In the absence of the LV.snap argument, the LV is rolled back to the most recent snapshot.  For rollback, the LV assigned LUN must be removed.  This command fails if LV is a shadow LV, to prevent changes to the LV while it is a shadow source or target.  Unshadow the LV before rollback.  Confirmation is required.

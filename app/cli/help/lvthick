The lvthick command transforms thin provisioned LVs into thick provisioned LVs.  For each thin extent in the LV an actual extent in the pool will be allocated. 

The command will fail if the number of thin extents in the LV is greater than the number of free extents in the pool.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify LVs:

        lvthick lv00-10

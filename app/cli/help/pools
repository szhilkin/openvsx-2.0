The pools command displays all VSX pools.  The display list can be restricted by providing one or more pool arguments.  The displayed status includes pool name, number of PVs, total size in gigabytes, unallocated (free) space in gigabytes, percentage of space used, and LV data extent allocation mode.  Mode 'concat' allocates LV data extents from the first PV in the pool that has enough extents.  Mode 'striped' allocates LV data extents round-robin from all PVs in the pool.  The -a flag displays additional information often useful for Coraid Technical Support.

Series ranging (see 'help series') may be used to specify pools:

	pools POOL00-10

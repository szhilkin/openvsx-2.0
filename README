This is the source for the Coraid VSX provided by the previous owners
of the technology.  Apparently, as is the case with the SRX, the
Coraid infrastructure required to build release were lost in the
turmoil after the reduction in force in January of 2015.  All internal
documentation on how to build the software was reportedly kept on web
based wikis that disappeared.  It is no longer
possible to create release as it was at Coraid in 2014.

The VSX, however, was a user level space system.  The VSX is an AoE
network storage virtualizer.  Basically it's NAT for AoE requests.
The code in srx/xlate compile into a user level daemon that does this
translation, and, in Plan 9 style, it implements a file server to
interact with the command line interpreter.

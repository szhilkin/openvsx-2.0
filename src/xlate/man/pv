.SH DESCRIPTION
This page describes the physical volume label.
The label is described using the notation used in the Plan 9
documentation for the 9P protoocol.
See intro(5).
.PP
The physical volume label is almost always the first extent on a target.
It enables the VSX to recreate volume pools and recreate the logical volumes
and online exported luns.
.PP
The label is laid out as follows:
.TP
.I magic\f1[4]\fP
the string "VSX0"
.TP
.I status\f1[4]\fP
indicates current status of PV
.TP
.I UUID\f1[8]\fP
this volume's universal unique identifier
.TP
.I ctime\f1[4]\fP
the time this volume was created
.TP
.I mtime\f1[4]\fP
the last time this pool was modified
.TP
.I aoedata\f1[4]\fP
the underlying AoE target with the storage
.TP
.I aoemeta\f1[4]\fP
target with to store the metadata
.TP
.I aoemirror\f1[4]\fP
partner mirror to aoedata
.TP
.I length\f1[8]\fP
in bytes of the physical volume
.TP
.I npve\f1[4]\fP
number of extents on this volume
.TP
.I PV\f1[ n ]\fP
physical volumes in this pool
.TP
.I pvname\f1[ s ]\fP
name of this physical volume
.TP
.I pvlabel\f1[ s ]\fP
label for the volume
.TP
.I poolname\f1[ s ]\fP
name of the pool of which the volume is a member
.TP
.I poollabel\f1[ s ]\fP
and its label
.PP
The format of a PV is as follows:
.TP
.I UUID\f1[9]\fP
the pool member uuid
.TP
.I aoetarget\f1[4]\fP
the metadata target for the volume
.PP
Notice that we want to know the metadata target.
It will have the other targets.
.PP
The number of PV slots are usually greater than the actual
number of PVs in the pool.
We need to preserve the index into the PV table since
they are referenced by the logical volume table.
Unused slots contain zero.
.SS
Mirroring
.PP
.I Aoemirror is the target that is an exact copy of the primary.
If the primary fails,
the aoemirror and aoedata will swap values
and the status will be broke mirror.
Any elements in the pool that store data on the target will
have its
.I aoemeta
variable changed to be the new primary.
The dirty bit in the PVE will be used to keep track
of extents changed since the mirror broke.
If the broken half is reunited with its partner
only the dirty blocks will be copied.
If the broken mirror is mated to a new partner
all the blocks are copied.
All writes will go to both.
Only reads will be serviced from the primary.
